# Example text mining tools

Here are some very basic sample scripts that we used for testing PubRunner. Some throw errors to allow us to do basic testing of the robustness of PubRunner.
 - [CountWords.py] - Simple script that does a naive word count of a set of abstracts
 - [CountWordsAndSometimesThrowError.py] - Same simple script but it will occassionally crash
 - [ThrowError.py] - Script that always crashes.
